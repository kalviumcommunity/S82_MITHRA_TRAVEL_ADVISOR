# üöÄ Project Title: GenAI Travel Advisor  

## üìñ Overview  
This project is developed as part of the **Gen AI Course (B2 level)**.  
The goal of this project is to design and implement a **Generative AI‚Äìbased Travel Advisor** that demonstrates creativity, automation, and real-world usefulness.  

The project explores **theoretical concepts** (how Gen AI works) and **technical implementation** (how we build and deploy the system).

## üéØ Project Idea  

- **Problem Statement:**  
  Planning a trip can be overwhelming‚Äîfinding destinations, creating itineraries, budgeting, and ensuring preferences (like food, activities, accessibility) match user needs takes a lot of time and research.  

- **Proposed Solution:**  
  A **Generative AI-powered Travel Advisor** that generates personalized itineraries, suggests destinations, provides travel tips, and answers user queries. It uses Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with real-time travel data APIs for reliable recommendations.  

- **Key Features:**  
  - Personalized itineraries (day-wise plans, activities, timings)  
  - Destination and attraction suggestions  
  - Food, culture, and local tips  
  - Budget breakdown and packing list generation  
  - Interactive chat-based interface  
  - Customization (budget, interests, accessibility, travel duration)  
  - Integration with real datasets/APIs for accuracy

## üß† Theoretical Concepts  

This project is built on **Generative AI fundamentals**, including:  

- **Neural Networks & Transformers:** Backbone of modern LLMs.  
- **Prompt Engineering:** Designing structured prompts for high-quality travel outputs.  
- **Few-shot Learning:** Providing example itineraries to guide responses.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Checking accuracy, personalization, creativity, and safety of generated plans.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation  

### üîπ System Architecture  

- **Frontend:**  
  - React.js / Next.js for user-friendly interface  
  - Interactive chat/dashboard for entering travel preferences  

- **Backend:**  
  - Node.js / Flask / FastAPI to handle API requests  
  - Middleware for prompt construction and validation  

- **AI Model:**  
  - OpenAI GPT / Hugging Face LLMs / Llama 2  
  - Pre-trained model with prompt templates for travel planning  

- **Database (optional):**  
  - PostgreSQL / MongoDB for storing user profiles, preferences, and logs  

- **Deployment:**  
  - Cloud (AWS / GCP / Azure) or local server  
  - Docker for containerization and easy scalability

## üìÇ Project Workflow  

1. User enters preferences (destination, budget, dates, interests).  
2. Backend processes input and creates a structured prompt.  
3. AI model generates an itinerary, travel tips, or recommendations.  
4. Backend formats response and sends it to the frontend.  
5. User receives itinerary in a clean, interactive format.  
6. Data is optionally stored for personalization and feedback.

## üöß Challenges & Future Scope  

- **Challenges:**  
  - Data privacy and ethical use of travel data  
  - Model limitations (hallucinations, outdated info)  
  - Handling multiple languages and cultural diversity  

- **Future Scope:**  
  - Add **multi-modal support** (maps, images of destinations)  
  - Real-time integration with **flight/hotel booking APIs**  
  - Improved personalization through **user profiles**  
  - Offline **PDF itinerary export**  

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Outcomes  

- A functional **Generative AI Travel Advisor**  
- Clear explanation of **theory + practical implementation**  
- Demonstration of **creativity, technical depth, and usefulness**  
- Improved **travel planning experience** with personalization and automation
